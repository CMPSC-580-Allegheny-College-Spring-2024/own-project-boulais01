# Project Prototype

## Key Features

This prototype runs a `pygame` in which the user
responds to two sample questions, which then
stores the data in a `json` file stored within
the `mousetracker/moustracker/data` directory.
It also features a command line output displaying
some prominent statistics from the data.
